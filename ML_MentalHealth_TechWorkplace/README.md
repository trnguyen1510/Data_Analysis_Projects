## Project Intro/Objective
Our objective is to analyze the attitude of tech workers towards mental health and the main predictors of mental health illness in the U.S. tech workplace. We explore and analyze the dataset "Mental Health in Tech workplace survey 2014", with questions had questions pertaining to how mental health is perceived at tech workplaces by employees and their employers.

## Project Description

Mental health has always been the central topic around workplace culture and wellness conversations. In a study of "mental well-being at the workplace" in 2010, it is increasingly recognized that employees' mental health is a crucial determinant in their overall health. Poor mental health and stressors at the workplace can contribute to a range of physical illnesses. Mental health can also affect their personal and professional lives (Rajgopal). Furthermore, mental issues such as depression and anxiety have a significant economic impact; the estimated cost to the global economy is US$1 trillion per year in lost productivity (who.int).

The dataset name is Mental Health in tech survey 2014.

This dataset contains the following data (column names):
* Timestamp
* Age
* Gender

* state: If you live in the United States, which state or territory do you live in?
* self_employed: Are you self-employed?
* family_history: Do you have a family history of mental illness?
* treatment: Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?
* work_interfere: If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?
* no_employees: How many employees does your company or organization have?
* remote_work: Do you work remotely (outside of an office) at least 50% of the time?
* tech_company: Is your employer primarily a tech company/organization?
* benefits: Does your employer provide mental health benefits?
* care_options: Do you know the options for mental health care your employer provides?
* wellness_program: Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?
* seek_help: Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?
* anonymity: Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources?
* leave: How easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition?
* mentalhealthconsequence: Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?
* physhealthconsequence: Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?
* coworkers: Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your coworkers?
* supervisor: Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor(s)?
* mentalhealthinterview: Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?
* physhealthinterview: Would you bring up a physical health issue with a potential employer in an interview?

* obs_consequence: Have you heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace?
* comments: Any additional notes or comments
